A secret santa application
In Secret Santa, people get picked at random as to who they would have to give a gift to and who they would get a gift from.
In certain circumstances people can't give other people gifts because of there select situations such as if they are imediate family members, if they were already going to give this person a gift already, etc.
Because of such people should be able to determine who they can and cannot give a gift to, but a problem most applications have with this is that, a feature as such does not exist.
This application aims to have the option whether someone can or cannot give a gift to someone under their own circumstances.
